<center><p>well, these are updates i push that aren't really done yet. i might implement them or not, it depends if i can get it working or not. this feature started with direct file hosting (uploading your files to my server to access later), but it didn't work as planned and i deprecated it. the contact-me form might go down that same route, as it's not working as i want it to. i'll give it more time but soon it will get deprecated if i can't get it to work. the difference between updates and experimental updates is that i know that regular updates work, but with experimental updates it's kinda the opposite. that's all you need to know about experimental updates for now. <br><br>toodles!   <b>- juls</b>
